# SNHU Travel Project - Sprint Review and Retrospective

This repository contains the Sprint Review and Retrospective from the SNHU Travel project, developed using the Scrum-Agile methodology. Below are reflections on key aspects of the software development process that were practiced and learned during this project.

## Reflections

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the goals and challenges of the end-users through direct communication or analysis of their feedback. User stories play a critical role in this process as they break down complex user requirements into specific, actionable tasks that can be tackled by the development team. Each user story focuses on a particular feature or functionality that delivers value to the user. By creating and prioritizing user stories, we can ensure that the most important needs are addressed first, allowing for a clear focus and alignment with the user's expectations. In the SNHU Travel project, user stories were crucial in guiding the development of the wellness vacation booking feature, helping the team to deliver functionality that met client needs effectively.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is iterative and adaptive, following Agile principles that allow for continuous delivery and improvement. I emphasize breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable increments and continuously gathering feedback from stakeholders. Agile processes, such as **Sprint Planning** and **Daily Standups**, are integral to my workflow, ensuring regular progress checks and the flexibility to make adjustments as necessary. Going forward, I plan to incorporate these processes, along with **Sprint Retrospectives** to review team performance and implement improvements. This iterative approach, used throughout the SNHU Travel project, allowed for quick adaptation to client feedback and ensured timely delivery of project milestones.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development goes beyond completing individual tasks. It means actively participating in team discussions, offering support to peers, and communicating effectively to ensure the whole team stays aligned. Collaboration is key in an Agile environment, and good team members contribute to this by providing constructive feedback, helping to resolve challenges, and removing obstacles that may impede progress. In the SNHU Travel project, effective communication during **Daily Standups** and **Sprint Reviews** fostered collaboration, enabling the team to resolve issues quickly and continue delivering value with each sprint.
